## Tool for migrating Opera emails to Thunderbird

This is a small python script that migrates local stored emails from Opera to Thunderbird.

The tool checks your Thunderbird and Opera accounts and make a suggestion which accounts
are possibly to migrate.

You can only migrate POP3 Accounts

This tool creates a new mbox file `Migration` and copies all e-mails from the Opera location in to it.
